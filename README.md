## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TailwindCSS

### What I learned

This was the first time i used tailwind. I managed to assign custom styles in the tailwind config. I also learned how to use tailwind plugin for prettier, so everything gets organized and clean.

### Continued development

Next step will be to add more recipes, trying to make calls to a database using Prisma so i can define a table structure and use it.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - The official tailwidn website has a lot of helpful resources to get started
